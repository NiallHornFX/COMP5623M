#### COMP5623M : CNN Classification & Visualisation 

###### Niall Horn - March 2022

___

##### Info

This was a small project for COMP5623M written at University of Leeds (2021/2022) to train a basic CNN architecture using supervised learning for image classification. Additionally the learnt filters, convolved feature maps and class weighted activations are visualised using Grad-CAM. 

Further information is provided on [my website](https://www.niallhorn.dev).

##### Usage

This repo currently contains just the Jupyter Notebook used to complete the assignment. I intend to come back to this and write it in pure Python form. 

____

##### Building

Requires Python 3.7+ and the required dependencies. Anaconda was used for development to making installing and managing dependencies easier, the environment can be reconstructed using : 

`conda create env -f enviro.yml` 

For grading sake the notebook was also saved as HTML file.

##### Dependencies

See `environment.yml`

The key libraries used include: 

* PyTorch

* Numpy

* OpenCV
